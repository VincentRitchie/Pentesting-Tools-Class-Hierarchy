## Description
This repository contains a Python project that implements a class hierarchy for different types of pentesting tools. The application allows users to create instances of various pentesting tools like Scanners, BruteForcers, and Exploiters, and execute them based on user input.

## Pseudocode

```
pseudocode

Define base class PentestingTool:
    Initialize attributes name, version, and category
    Define method run():
        Raise NotImplementedError
    Define method __str__():
        Return string representation of the tool

Define subclass Scanner inheriting from PentestingTool:
    Initialize attributes name and version, set category to "Scanner"
    Override method run(target):
        Print running scanner on target

Define subclass BruteForcer inheriting from PentestingTool:
    Initialize attributes name and version, set category to "Brute Forcer"
    Override method run(target, wordlist):
        Print running brute force attack on target with wordlist

Define subclass Exploiter inheriting from PentestingTool:
    Initialize attributes name and version, set category to "Exploiter"
    Override method run(target, exploit):
        Print exploiting target with exploit

Define function create_tool():
    Prompt user to input type, name, and version of tool
    Return instance of Scanner, BruteForcer, or Exploiter based on user input

Define function main():
    Call create_tool() to create a tool
    If tool is created:
        Prompt user for target IP address
        If tool is BruteForcer, prompt for wordlist and call run(target, wordlist)
        If tool is Exploiter, prompt for exploit and call run(target, exploit)
        Otherwise, call run(target)

Call main() to run the application

```

## Features
- **Dynamic Tool Creation:** Users can create different types of pentesting tools by specifying the tool type, name, and version.
- **Tool Execution:** Execute the tools on specified targets with additional parameters based on the tool type.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VincentRitchie/Pentesting-Tools-Class-Hierarchy.git
cd Pentesting-Tools-Class-Hierarchy
```

## Usage
To use this project, run the following command:

```sh
python pentesting_tools.py
```

Follow the prompts to create and execute your pentesting tools.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Additional Tool Types**
   - **Description**: Introduce more pentesting tool types such as NetworkSniffer, VulnerabilityScanner, etc.
   - **Benefit**: Expands the range of tools the application can simulate.

### 2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   - **Description**: Develop a more advanced CLI to support additional options and flags.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a more robust and user-friendly interface for power users.

### 3. **Integration with Real Tools**
   - **Description**: Integrate the application with actual pentesting tools like Nmap, Metasploit, etc.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances functionality by allowing real-world usage.

### 4. **Task Automation**
   - **Description**: Allow users to script and automate sequences of pentesting tasks.
   - **Benefit**: Increases efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.

### 5. **Output Logging**
   - **Description**: Implement logging of tool outputs to a file.
   - **Benefit**: Keeps a record of all actions performed, useful for auditing and reporting.
